modeling dynamic systems in biology

## practical 1

modeling of enzyme reaction using michaelis-menten formula and law of mass action.

simulations of variation of concentrations with changing inital conditions.

## practical 2

compound synthesis-degradation model

constitutive gene expression model
gene -> mRNA -> Protein

simplified gene expression model with quasi-steady state for mRNA concentration is assumed.
gene -> protein

activated and repressed gene expression

study of Hill function

positive and negative feedback
some genes regulate themselves


## practical 3
modeling of genetic osillator
3 genes mutually repressive
